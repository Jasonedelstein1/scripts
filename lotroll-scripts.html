                <ul>
                    <li>If you can afford first & last month's rent, <span class="highlight">you can afford to stop paying landlords and start building equity</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Let's do the math using this 3bed/2bath manufactured home in Aurora, Colorado.</li>
                    
                    <li>The listing price is $155k, so at 5% down, that's just $7,750—<span class="highlight">less than what most people pay for first, last, and deposit</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Lot rent here is $860/month, and your monthly payment on a 10-year loan is $1,900. That's $2,760 total—about the same as renting a 3-bedroom house in Aurora.</li>
                    
                    <li>But here's the difference: <span class="highlight">After 10 years, you OWN it</span>. Your payment drops to just $860/month for lot rent, or you can sell it and pocket the equity as a down payment on a traditional house.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I want you to guess how much this home costs— it's 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1300 square feet. Built in 2025. Spacious modern kitchen, it's in a quiet neighborhood in Aurora…</li>
                    
                    <li><span class="highlight">What's your guess? $300k, $400k?</span></li>
                    
                    <li>This home is actually just $155,000. Why? Because it's a manufactured home aka a mobile home. But from the outside, and the inside, it just looks like a regular house, in a regular neighborhood.</li>
                    
                    <li>In today's housing market, <span class="highlight">the starter home doesn't exist</span>. First-time buyers are stuck renting because nothing is affordable.</li>
                    
                    <li>But here's the thing: if you can afford first and last month's rent, you can afford the down payment on this home. And in 5-7 years, you could own it outright, sell it, and use that equity as a down payment on a traditional house.</li>
                    
                    <li>At LotRoll, we're changing the housing market by <span class="highlight">giving first-time homebuyers options that are actually affordable</span> and actually meet their needs.</li>
