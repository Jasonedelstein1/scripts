Ask Education Through Music Colorado.
Or better yet — ask them.

Can we play now?!

<span class="direction">(Music bursts in — percussion, laughter, rhythm. The classroom glows.)</span>

There's something magical happening here, especially when you realize that not long ago, this classroom was silent.

<span class="direction">(The camera slows — Clifton and students fade from frame. Empty chairs. Dusty instruments. Silence.)</span>

<span class="speaker">NARRATOR</span> <span class="direction">(somber)</span>
Like so many schools in Colorado, music education was lost to budget cuts — the instruments gathered dust, and the silence was heavy.

<span class="speaker">NARRATOR</span> <span class="direction">(hopeful, inspiring)</span>
At a school near you, a teacher is still missing.

When you help bring music back, you give children more than melodies — you give them confidence, belonging, and the courage to express who they are.

<span class="speaker">KARISSA</span> <span class="direction">(direct, warm)</span>
What do you remember about your elementary school music class?

For many children in Colorado, the answer is nothing.

Because they've never had one.

<span class="speaker">KARISSA</span> <span class="direction">(earnest, conversational)</span>
Our schools are deeply underfunded, and music is often the first thing to disappear.

Walk into some of these classrooms and you'll still see the traces of what once was —
a dusty piano, silent instruments, the absence of a teacher who once filled the room with song.

The music is gone. The classroom is quiet.

<span class="direction">(B-roll: joyful classroom → fades to dark, empty classroom.)</span>

<span class="speaker">KARISSA</span> <span class="direction">(warm, inspiring)</span>
At Education Through Music–Colorado, we believe music isn't an extra — it's essential.

Research shows that when students make music, they build confidence, focus, and a love of learning that carries into everything they do.

That's why we place dedicated, full-time music teachers in under-resourced public schools — making music part of every child's school day.

We support our music teachers, and others in the state, in building engaging music programs for all learners. In these ways, we ensure students in marginalized communities have equitable access to the benefits of music education.

<span class="direction">(B-roll: unused instrument → student playing; empty desk → Clifton teaching; students smiling, moving, creating.)</span>

<span class="speaker">KARISSA</span> <span class="direction">(closing, heartfelt)</span>
Think back to your own music class —
that teacher, that instrument, that song you played together that still lives in your mind.

That mix of anticipation and pride standing on stage, your family watching.

Help us give that memory to another child- because music changes everything.

When school budgets are tight, music is the first program to be cut.

And when music disappears, children lose more than songs — they lose confidence, curiosity, and the joy of being heard.

But with your support, we can place dedicated, full-time music teachers in under-resourced public schools — making music part of every child's school day.
