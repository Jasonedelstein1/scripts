                    If you're looking to get hair extensions done in Denver, here are 3 helpful things to consider
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    #1 They require maintenance just like your natural hair, but probably not as much as you think, typically an average of an hour and half in the salon every 6 weeks
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    #2 They can damage your natural hair if done improperly, this is why I've been certified by 5 different companies in different installation methods to learn as much as possible about how and why to install in very specific ways that prioritize the health of your hair above all
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    #3 Similarly to affecting the health of your natural hair, if done improperly they can also look obvious, one of my favorite things is when my clients come back and say "I've been getting compliments but no one seems to know I have extensions in!" They almost want people to know, but for me this is a huge compliment, that they are undetectable and natural looking is the goal
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="body-text">
                        I got hair extensions for my wedding, and now I wear them all the time.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        I planned to just keep them in for the honeymoon, but when we got back I just didn't want to take them out!
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        Sloan did an amazing job with the installation, and it actually only took an hour.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        But I think what really made me feel comfortable about working with her was her focus on my existing hair health, and making sure I could keep up with the maintenance. Even though I thought I was just going to have the extensions in for a couple of weeks, I could tell that she had my long-term hair health in mind every step of the way.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        If you're looking for hair extensions in the Denver area, I highly recommend booking a consultation with Sloan.

                    If you want thicker, fuller hair with more volume, texture, and length hand tied hair extensions are likely the perfect solution.
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    That being said they're not for everyone, they do require some maintenance and can be done improperly leading to damage or clearly visible wefts, which is why my top priorities when selecting a method, type of hair and placement, is the health of your natural hair, and blend of colors to make them as safe, natural and undetectable as possible.
